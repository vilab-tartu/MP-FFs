### Melting point estimation workflow ###

# Initialization #
The workflow is done on Choline Acetate example. It is located in the Ac folder, D1000 subfolder
The worflow is initialized by filling in the 1.sh, 2.sh, 3.sh, 4.sh scripts and gathering force fields in the template/top folder.

The variables in the sh script to be changed: ion names, ion lengths (number of atoms), ionic pair molecular weight (g/mol), initial package density (kg/dm3)
D1000 in the example folder name indicates the initial package density is 1.0 kg/dm3

The force fields should be appropriately named and placed in the top folder.


# Production #
After initialization, the sh scripts are run in succession: 1.sh, 2.sh, 3.sh, 4.sh
These script will call upon other scripts and programs, e.g. packmol to pack the initial system, wells script to first calculate system size and later to add potential wells,
unwells script to remove potential wells, GROMACS to create MD input files, and corresponding run files (1.run, 2.run, 3.run, 4.run).

These run files are configured to submit the MD input files and launch MD simulations in the SLURM high performance computing environment.
In principle, all code (except headers and module loading) can be copied into sh scripts or other HPC environment submit file templates to carry out simulations in any environment.

Example results are shown in NaCl_333 and CsCl_332 folders.


# Analysis #
analyze_traj.py script analyzes the trajectories and creates figures with D/T dependencies with regression fits of solid and liquid phase regions.
msd.sh script is used by analye_traj.py script to calculate mean square deviations and diffusion coefficients during simulations using GROMACS.

Required initializon: root path of results to analyze, lists of systems to analyze (anion names, initial packing densities, subsystems such as NaCl_333, CsCl_332, reference melting points).
If analysis is run for some systems for multiple times, then it is wise to comment out the line that calls for msd.sh script with os.system module.

Example is shown with Choline Acetate, NaCl_333 and CsCl_332 systems with D1000 initial packing density (1.0 kg/dm3). 

Outputs include: 1p (shows anion name, predicted MP (K), average of predictions for different systems among the same anion(K))
1psys (shows the system which was used for the final MP prediction, i.e. the system with highes MP that had sufficient regression fits, etc)
lntemp folder contains D/T fit graphs of all systems
lnpub folder contains D/T fits of the systems that were used for final MP prediction


# Charges #
In current work, charges were scaled between identical melting point estimation workflows. I.e. all previous steps were done with DFT charges, then charges were scaled and workflow restarted.
Initial charges were obtained from DFT simulation of single ions in vacuum, so charges were simply pasted into ITP files without any additional scripts.
Then the systems packed and simulated with the DFT charges were taken as input for GN2-xTB calculations.

Charge scaling workflow is as follows:

A sufficiently large system pdb file is required. E.g. simulation snapshots from the melting point estimation workflow
The scripts are initialized, e.g. xtb path, cation length if anything other than choline is used, anion name, subsystems of anion (e.g. NaCl_333).
The pdb2xyz.py script is used to generate an xyz files from pdb-s. charges_calculation script calls GFN2-xTB calculations and charges_assign.py script calculates averaged atomic charges.

The obtained charges are by deafult in Ch_Anion folder. They are to be substituted into itp force fields of corresponding ions and used within a new melting point determination workflow.
The example files are for Choline Acetate charge calculation.
