NOTE: Turning on dynamic load balancing


Writing final coordinates.

 Average load imbalance: 29.3 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 10.9 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 1 % Y 1 %

NOTE: 10.9 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
